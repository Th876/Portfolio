    <p class="p-about">My name is Tahaylia. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer (Web design, Front-End, Back-End). I first got <br />bitten
      by the 'coding bug' when I graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago as a Modern Languages major
      and was looking to quench my ‘creative thirst’ while job hunting. I chose to occupy my time with photo editing
      and logo designing via Adobe Photoshop, as well as video editing with Premiere Pro. These creative undertakings quickly reminded me of how much I enjoyed
      personalizing a blog I once had with snippets of<br />html code.</p><p class="p-about">I then decided to fully immerse myself into the wonderful world of scripting/programming 
      languages via self-study, and, needless to say—I was hooked! The joy I feel from designing and developing web pages has influenced my decision to switch my career path to the Tech industry. 
      So, I enrolled at Arizona State<br />University (ASU) except there was one major issue—my I.T. program did not fully delve into web development and I could not enroll into the program that did, because I did not meet their technical background requirements as a Liberal Arts degree holder. 
      <br /><p class="p-about">One step backward? More like forward! This only made me want to go the 'extra mile' to break into this field. I, therefore, took a 3-month hiatus from ASU to self-study with the use of online resources, 
      books, and some notes from a web development class I took one semester and it has been a delightful challenge. Since then, ASU started a new degree program for Full-Stack Web Development. I have enrolled in this program and am learning the skills I lacked as a former autodidact learner so that I can contribute greatly to the field of technology.</p>
