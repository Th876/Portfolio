       </div>
       <div class="left-column">My name is Tahaylia. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer (Web design, Front-End, Back-End). I first got bitten by the 'coding bug' when I graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago as a Modern Languages major and was looking to quench my ‘creative thirst’ while job hunting. I chose to occupy my time with photo editing and logo designing via Adobe Photoshop, as well as video editing with Premiere Pro.<br/><br/> These creative undertakings quickly reminded me of how much I enjoyed personalizing a blog I once had with snippets of html code. I then decided to fully immerse myself into the wonderful world of scripting/programming languages via self-study, and, needless to say—I was hooked!<br/><br/>The joy I feel from designing and developing web pages has influenced my decision to switch my career path to the Tech industry.
       </div>
       <div class="center-column">So, I enrolled at Arizona State University (ASU) except there was one major issue—my I.T. program did not fully delve into web development and I could not enroll into the program that did, because I did not meet their technical background requirements as a Liberal Arts degree holder. 
     <br/><br/>One step backward? More like forward! This only made me want to go the 'extra mile' to break into this field. I, therefore, took a 3-month hiatus from ASU to self-study with the use of online resources, books, and some notes from a web development class I took one semester and it has been a delightful challenge. <br/><br/>Since then, ASU started a new degree program for Full-Stack Web Development and I have enrolled in that program to learn the skills I lacked as a former autodidact learner. I look foward to contributing greatly to the field of technology.
